        <p>Hey Colleague, <br /><br/>
            You are that antique piece who I met at the start of the project and somehow stuck together till the end of it. You were my favorite senior and a great mentor (although I have some serious doubts on those guidance).
            <br /> <br />Unfortunately I had to go through a lot of trauma due to your bathroom singing and that annoying voice. Ironically, I will be missing those same things a lot going forward. 
            <br />I'll miss you so much!!
