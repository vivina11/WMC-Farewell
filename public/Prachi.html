        <p>Hey Beautiful Poo, <br /><br/>
            You are that person with whom I never imagined to ever be friends with given we were (and still are) poles apart. Yet we have come a long way together and I truly wish for all the great things to happen to you in your journey ahead.
            <br/> <br/>I can't thank you enough for making my first day in office a bit more bearable.
            You've been an incredible mentor to me this past year, and I'll always appreciate the time you took to help me understand things and grow. 
            <br />I'll miss you so much!!
        </p>
