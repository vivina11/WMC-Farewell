        <p>Hey Cutie munchkin, <br /><br/>
        You are one of the most adorable person I have ever met. You are my favorite nightingale (who does not speak Hindi but can sing Hindi and Punjabi songs like a Pro), most kind hearted and a down to earth friend I could ever have. 
        <br /><br/> I know you are a girl with big dreams even if you are still confused about them currently. I will always be rooting for you to become a woman with vision and the best version of yourself. 
        <br />I'll miss you so much!!
        </p>
