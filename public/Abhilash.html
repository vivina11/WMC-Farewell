        <p>Hey Chipmunk, <br /><br/>
            You are the only person whom I can call a dear friend in such a short span of time (Stop calling me Aap). I truly wish for best of your health and I hope to meet you in person someday soon.
            <br /> <br /> I do see you going places because of your immense potential (even if you are not aware of it) but dare you forget me when you reach there. I won't say you will the next Alan Turing, but I can proudly say you will be the first Abhilash. 
            <br/>I'll miss you so much!!
